#### 1. Core Gameplay Mechanics
##### a. Our game is a combat platformer RPG. The player character will be going throughout a dungeon, defeating enemies and gaining allies.
##### b. The controls will be the typical WASD to move and then space to jump. To attack/use ability, it will be a mouse click. Certain passive abilities can also be activated by pressing E. 
##### c. After every level, you get visual and audio confirmation. A little jingle will play and a card will come up saying “Level _ defeated.” 

#### 2. Story and Setting
##### a. This game will have a basic narrative. The player character wakes up in a dungeon where they are greeted by the first companion, Alistair. The companions met throughout the dungeon will help convey the narrative and give a nice story.
##### b. The game atmosphere is in a dungeon, so there it will be somewhat dark. The main idea for enemies are shadow monsters bent on ridding the world of light, so the dungeon being dark works most of the time.

#### 3. Art and Sound Design
##### a. Pixel art, 2d
##### b. We will be using custom assets.
##### c. Growling, hitting when in battle, level compete and level up,walking,battle music  

#### 4. Difficulty and Progression
##### a. Enemies will become stronger and more powerful
##### b. Multiple stages as well as change in textures 

#### 5. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)
##### a. There will be a progression menu that can be used when enough XP is gathered and there will be an inventory menu where you can switch out armor, weapons, etc and do some other functions. We will also have the main menu and the menu to save the game and options.
##### b. We believe that it is fairly accessible as they are controls that most people would know well.

#### 6. Technical Requirements
##### a. Pixel, Processing, Unity(maybe)
##### b. We will need an AI model for the enemies attack patterns and movement.

#### 7. Team Roles and Collaboration
##### a. Stephen Wallace will take on coding and art, Penny Jorgensen will be focusing on story writing and coding.
##### b. We will collaborate on Github for the most part.

#### 8. Target Audience
##### a. This game is intended for casual gamers who are teens and older. 
##### b. Our game design will make it so you can play in short bursts then come back each time and still have fun with the gameplay and story. Then with violence and fighting being one of the main draws of the game, a E10+ or a T rating for this game would probably make the most sense.
